        Covid-19 in children: Here's how to identify symptoms and what parents
        should know
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has listed several ways and
        guidelines to identify if children have Covid-19 symptoms and how to
        manage the condition.

        As adults and the elderly rush to vaccination centres to get the
        critically needed dosage of the Covid-19 vaccine, a group that is yet to
        be fully looked after are children. With the second wave of Covid-19
        battering states after states, the next focus of concern are children
        who are likely to be most vulnerable if the third wave of the virus
        strikes. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has listed several
        ways and guidelines to identify if children have Covid-19 symptoms and
        how to manage the condition. The Health Ministry in a tweet said that
        "majority children with Covid-19 infection may be asymptomatic or mildly
        symptomatic in nature.Being asymptomatic refers to the fact that a
        person has Covid-19 but is not showing any symptoms of the disease. This
        can last for around 14 days which makes it more severe as the
        asymptomatic person ends up transmitting the virus to a lot of people,
        fuelling the pandemic. Similarly, pre-symptomatic people experience
        cough, fever, or breathing difficulty while not showing any symptoms in
        the beginning despite testing positive for the virus.

        The Health Ministry said that the common symptoms among children might
        include fever, cough, breathlessness or shortness of breath, fatigue,
        sore throat, myalgia (muscle pains, aches, pain in ligaments),
        rhinorrhea (excess drainage, ranging from a clear fluid to thick mucus
        from the nose), diarrhoea, loss of smell, loss of taste. Meanwhile, few
        children might also show symptoms of gastrointestinal issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ministry also noted that a new syndrome known as system inflammatory
        syndrome has also been seen in children, such cases are characterised by
        unremitting fever.

      <h3>Managing children with asymptomatic Covid-19</h3>
      <p>
        Children who are asymptomatic Covid-19 positive can be managed at home.
        The ministry said that such children are identified during screening if
        family members are identified as Covid positive. They require monitoring
        for the development of symptoms and subsequent treatment. Meanwhile,
        children with mid diseases may have a sore throat, cough, or little
        breathing issues that do not require any investigation. The Health
        Ministry recommends that such children should be managed at home with
        home isolation and symptomatic treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ministry in a tweet also recommended keeping children with
        comorbidities underlying heart conditions, chronic lung disease, chronic
        organ dysfunction at home and getting them treatment at home.

      <h3>Vaccination for children</h3>
      <p>
        Amid a vaccine crunch in India, the clinical trial nod to Bharat
        Biotech's Covaxin to inoculate children in the age group of 2-12 years
        is being welcomed across the country. Experts believe that a paediatric
        range of the vaccine will soon be available in the market. The Bharat
        Biotech clinical trial will involve 525 healthy volunteers below 18
        years of age.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from Covaxin, Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D has been tested on children
        above 12 years in the US where the government has already authorized the
        use of Pfizer’s vaccine on kids.
